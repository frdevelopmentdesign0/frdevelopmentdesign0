Hi, I'm Filipa and I'm currently learning more about other programming languages than the ones I've been learning during these years. 
I took a high school degree in IT Management, did a year in Web Technologies and Mobile Apps development and now I'm an intern in Communication Technologies. I also have a HUGE 
passion in Digital Marketing and Design which is also important when advertising my apps or websites.
